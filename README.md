## FileExplorerSimulator
### This is a work in progress.

### Description:
#### &ensp; This is a simulation of a file explorer. I have taken some inspiration from Linux command line.
#### &ensp; A tree is used to store the directories.

### Commands:
#### &ensp; Commands must be called on their own on the command line.
* mkdir - creates new directory
* cd - changes to directory
* ls - lists children directories
